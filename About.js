            <p>The about us page is there to project nothing
            I am watching the tutuorial video while typing this so that it looks like I am busy
            it is purposeful and thoroughly helpfult. What I have a problem with is that the 
            coding programs don't have spell checks and grammar checks. It is totally unacceptable to me
            I cannot seem to wrap my mind around all that is going on with this.</p>
